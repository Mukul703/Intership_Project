## ## Objective

Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s dataset to extract **actionable insights** supporting **content strategy, audience engagement, and data-driven decisions** to maximize subscriptions and retention.

**Tools Used:**
- Google Colab Notebook (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- CSV data (`titles.csv`, `credits.csv`)

**Data Domain:** OTT Streaming / Entertainment Analytics

---

## ## Data Preparation

- **Merged** `titles.csv` and `credits.csv` on `id` to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- **Null Handling:**
  - Filled missing categorical fields with `'Unknown'` or `'Not applicable'`.
  - Filled missing numerical fields (`imdb_score`, `imdb_votes`, `tmdb_popularity`, `tmdb_score`) with median values.
  - Dropped rows with missing `imdb_id`.
- **Duplicates:** Removed 168 duplicate rows.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Converted `seasons`, `imdb_votes` to `int64`.
- **Logical Consistency Checks:** Ensured non-negative `runtime`, valid `imdb_score`, `tmdb_score` values.

The dataset was made **clean, consistent, and ready for EDA**.
